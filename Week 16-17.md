# Project Summary/Completion of a Written Report and Video Editing, etc.
## Improvements:

1.Power Limitation on Arduino Board: Due to the limited power capacity of the Arduino board, it cannot handle too many air pumps and valves operating simultaneously. You can enhance the stability of their operation by using relays to independently provide power to the air pumps and valves.

2.Using a Separate Camera: Instead of using a laptop, using a separate camera offers greater convenience and portability. In this case, the Arduino board may not meet the requirements, and you can consider switching to a Raspberry Pi board, which provides more computational capabilities and can better meet the project's needs.
