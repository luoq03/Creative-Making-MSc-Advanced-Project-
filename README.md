### :one: >>>>>  **GER MOOD SWEATER**

:small_blue_diamond: ***How it works :***  

The Galvanic Extimacy Responder (GER) is a soft sensor that relies on Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) to measure electrodermal activity. GSR has traditionally been employed in conventional lie detector tests to gauge the levels of excitement or arousal. SENSOREE's GER sensor is designed to facilitate "extimacy," which involves externalizing one's inner emotional state to the outside world.

These sensors are strategically positioned on the hands to detect and measure excitement levels. Subsequently, the collected data is translated into a spectrum of affective colors. The Mood Sweater, characterized by its bowl-shaped, high collar, incorporates LED lights that are positioned to illuminate the wearer's own body, providing instant biofeedback. Additionally, they serve as a tele-display or an external indicator of emotional states, communicating with others in a unique way.

Located around the neck, specifically near the larynx, this visual interface introduces a novel language of light and color to convey an individual's emotional state.

### 2️⃣ >>>>> **AWE FLEXO**

:small_blue_diamond: ***How it works :*** 

AWE FLeXo is a flexible exoskeleton designed for therapeutic purposes, with the goal of enhancing the profound emotions of awe and wonder. The exoskeleton, referred to as "flexo," incorporates a hexagonal grid on its back that serves to amplify the psychological experience of awe, often characterized by the sensation of goosebumps. This design element essentially transforms the perception of awe into a tangible, super-powered manifestation.

AWE FLeXo also delves into the exploration of inflatable structures, building upon the concepts initially introduced in the AWE Goosebumps design. The wearer's breathing patterns are visually represented externally through the use of illuminated blue LEDs during inhalation and green LEDs during exhalation.

When the wearer experiences a sense of awe, specific pockets within the exoskeleton inflate and emit a pink glow. This inflation not only enhances the wearer's own experience of awe but also serves as a means of externalizing and sharing their internal sensations. This fosters a form of "extimacy," allowing the wearer to communicate their inner emotional state with others, thereby promoting a deeper connection and understanding of their feelings.
